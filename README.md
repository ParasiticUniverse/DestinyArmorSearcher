# DestinyArmorSearcher
searches your Destiny 2 armor to find pieces you can safely dismantle. Essentially, this tool finds pieces that are strictly better than other pieces, i.e. all stats of piece A are better than or equal to those on piece B. You can also choose to ignore certain stats. The goal of the tool is to save you some vault space.

# Requirements:
Requires Python 3.

# Usage:
From the main Github page, use the Code button to download the code as zip and extract.

From Destiny Item Manager (https://destinyitemmanager.com/), go to the Organizer tab, and select a Destiny class (doesn't matter which). A new button will appear in the top right, "Armor.csv". Download this file and place in the same folder as the main Python file, then run the Python file (.bat file included for Windows). I have attached my destinyArmor.csv file for reference, simply replace this file with yours.

Now you can configure the search to ignore certain stats. I recommend ignoring Masterwork tier always, and then it depends on your class and playstyle. For example, on a PvE warlock, I would tend to ignore mobility.
